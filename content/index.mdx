# About the Texas A&M Sesquicentennial Digital Exhibit

## Celebrating 150 Years of Aggie History

The Texas A&M University Libraries proudly presents this interactive digital exhibit commemorating the sesquicentennial—150 years—of our beloved institution. From its founding as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in 1876 to its evolution into one of the nation's premier research universities, Texas A&M's story is one of growth, innovation, and unwavering commitment to excellence in education, research, and service.

## A Living Map of Campus Evolution

This digital exhibit transforms how we explore and understand our university's rich heritage through cutting-edge technology and thoughtful curation. At its heart lies a dynamic, interactive map that allows visitors to witness the remarkable transformation of our campus across fifteen decades. Watch as the original four buildings of the Agricultural and Mechanical College grow into today's sprawling 5,200-acre campus, home to over 70,000 Aggies.

## Features and Navigation

**Comprehensive Search**: Our robust search functionality enables you to discover specific buildings, historical periods, architectural styles, or significant events with ease. Whether you're researching the construction of the Academic Building or exploring the development of student life facilities, find exactly what you're looking for.

**Historical Timelines**: Experience the university's growth through carefully curated timelines that contextualize campus development within broader historical moments—from Reconstruction-era Texas through two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Civil Rights era, and into the digital age.

## Mission and Vision

This exhibit serves multiple constituencies: current students seeking to understand their place in Aggie history, alumni reconnecting with cherished campus memories, researchers studying institutional development, and community members exploring our shared heritage. By making our archives and historical collections digitally accessible, we ensure that the story of Texas A&M remains vibrant and discoverable for future generations.

The Texas A&M University Libraries is committed to preserving and providing access to the documentary heritage of our institution. This digital exhibit represents our ongoing efforts to leverage technology in service of scholarship, education, and community engagement.
